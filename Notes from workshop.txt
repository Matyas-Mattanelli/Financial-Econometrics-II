Part A
- try average RV forecast - done
- train the model on a different target - take an average of all t+h RVs and this is my dependent variable at time t - done
- change the left hand side of the equation, right hand remains the same - done
- implement for all kernels - done
- do not consider values of 1 and higher for the bandwidths - done

Part B
- square the volatility to be comparable in the plot! - done
- try putting the dot after the predict function for ARCHmodels
- average RV forecast as in part A ??
- incorporate rolling window (currently only 1, 5, and 22 values are compared in MSE)

Part C
- take the last coefficients and make the predictions - done

Part Final fusion
- compare the forecasts using statistical tests from Finecox I (if the MSE is significantly lower/higher)
