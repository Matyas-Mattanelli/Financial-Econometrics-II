Part A
- try cumulative RV forecast
- train the model on a different target - take an average of all t+h RVs and this is my dependent variable at time t
- change the left hand side of the equation, right hand remains the same
- implement for all kernels
- do not consider values of 1 and higher for the bandwidths

Part B
- square the volatility to be comparable in the plot!
- try putting the dot after the predict function for ARCHmodels

Part C
- take the last coefficients and make the predictions

Part Final fusion
- compare the forecasts using statistical tests from Finecox I (if the MSE is significantly lower/higher)
